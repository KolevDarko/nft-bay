This is a Smart contract and decentralized Application(dApp) that allows anyone to auction off their NFT tokens in
a completely decentralized manner.

This root repository contains the smart contracts and test for the contracts.

There is one main smart contract, AuctionManager and then there is also a sample TokenMinter for creating Nft's for testing.

The source code for the client dApp is contained in the /client directory. It is a ReactJS application bootstrapped with create-react-app.

Install everything here with: npm install

Deploy with truffle migrate.

Run tests with truffle test.

Of course you need to be connected to a blockchain to migrate or test the smart contracts.
